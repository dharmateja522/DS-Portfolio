## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Wafer Fault Detection](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/tree/master/WaferFaultDetection): A Model to build a classification methodology to predict the quality of wafer sensors based on the given training data.
	- [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/tree/master/sentiment_analysis): A simple model to determine whether given sentence is a positive (or) Negative sentence.

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Flask, Pycharm_ 

- ### Computer Vision

	- [Fashion Apparel Classification](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/tree/master/Fashion_Apparel_Classification): A simple CNN model to determine different Categories of Fashion Apparel.

	- [Helmet Detection](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/tree/master/Helmet_Detection): A Model to detect whether a person is wearing a Helmet (or) not.

	_Tools: Tensorflow, Flask_

- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Language Identification](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/tree/master/languageIdentification): In this project we will be doing language identification over six international lanuages i.e English, German, French, Espanol, Chinese and Russian. Here the user need to give recordings of the specific language as input and finally the input language will be predicted.
	
	_Tools: NLTK, scikit, Tensorflow, Flask_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Diabetes Dataset - EDA](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/Diabetes/Diabtes%20F.ipynb): Analysing whether a person is a diabetic (or) not a diabetic.
		- [HR Prediction on Salary - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/HR%20Prediction/hr-analysis-prediction-and-visualisation.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the employees, and looking into various parameters that resulted in a Attriation over it's employees.
		- [Flight Price](https://github.com/dharmateja522/DS-Portfolio/blob/master/Flight%20Price/Flight%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb): Analysis of Flights flying behaviour, including change in price over time and the  prediction of Prices.
