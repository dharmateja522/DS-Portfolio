# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Flight Price Prediction** project repository! This project is designed to predict the price of flight tickets based on various features such as departure and arrival locations, flight duration, and other relevant factors. The repository includes datasets, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a model for making predictions.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key files and directories in this repository:

- **Flight_Ticket_Participant_Datasets/** - Contains the original datasets used for the flight price prediction project.
- **Data_Train.xlsx** - The training dataset used for building the predictive model.
- **Final_Pred.xlsx** - The final predictions generated by the model on the test set.
- **Flight Price Prediction.ipynb** - The main Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.
- **Sample_submission.xlsx** - A sample submission file structure used for competitions or testing the model output format.
- **Test_set.xlsx** - The test dataset used to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-price-prediction.git
   cd flight-price-prediction

2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, then run:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the EDA and model development:

bash

jupyter notebook "Flight Price Prediction.ipynb"
4. Make Predictions:
Use the trained model within the notebook to make predictions on the test dataset (Test_set.xlsx). The predictions can be found in the Final_Pred.xlsx file.
