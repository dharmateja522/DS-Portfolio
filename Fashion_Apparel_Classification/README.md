## üìÅ Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key directories and files in this repository:

- **com_predict/** - Contains scripts and modules used for making predictions on input images.
- **com_utils/** - Utility scripts that support the core functionalities of the project, such as data processing and model management.
- **models/** - Directory where pre-trained or newly trained models are stored.
- **Procfile** - Configuration file used for deploying the application on platforms like Heroku.
- **clientApp.py** - Main script that runs the client application interface, allowing users to input images and receive predictions.
- **inputImage.jpg** - Example input image used for testing the model's prediction capabilities.
- **predict.json** - JSON file containing sample prediction results from the model.
- **requirements.txt** - Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.
- **runtime.txt** - Specifies the runtime environment for deploying the application.
