## üìÅ Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the key files in this repository:

- **Income Prediction.ipynb** - The Jupyter Notebook for predicting employee income. This notebook includes data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.
- **WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv** - The dataset used for HR analysis, focusing on employee attrition.
- **hr-analysis-prediction-and-visualisation.ipynb** - The Jupyter Notebook for HR analysis and prediction, containing data visualization, analysis of employee attrition, and model development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/income-hr-analysis.git
   cd income-hr-analysis

2. Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, then run:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks:
Open the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the EDA and model development:

bash

jupyter notebook "Income Prediction.ipynb"
jupyter notebook "hr-analysis-prediction-and-visualisation.ipynb"
4. Explore the Data:
Dive into the notebooks to explore the datasets, run the analyses, and understand the predictions made by the models.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
Income Prediction: Analyze and predict employee income using the Income Prediction.ipynb notebook, which includes comprehensive EDA and model training.
HR Analysis and Visualization: Explore employee attrition and other HR metrics using the hr-analysis-prediction-and-visualisation.ipynb notebook, which features data visualization and predictive modeling.
Comprehensive EDA: Both notebooks contain detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and drive model performance.
Model Training: Train and evaluate models to predict outcomes related to income and HR metrics.
